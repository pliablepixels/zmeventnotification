Note
-----
This is a newer version of ES (7.x) that I'm redoing for zmNg support and better features.
Read about what is [different](CHANGES.md). 

What
----
The Event Notification Server sits along with ZoneMinder and offers real time notifications, support for push notifications as well as Machine Learning powered recognition.
As of today, it supports:
* detection of 80 types of objects (persons, cars, etc.) 
* face recognition
* deep license plate recognition
